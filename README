This is wireshark packet dissector for protocols used in RHCS.

I've written wireshark packet dissectors for higher level protocols of
rhel5(cluster 2?)/rhel6(cluster 3) cluster.  See screenshots/clvmd.png.

Coverage of the communications:

    corosync_totemnet: Most of all but new encryption method.
      corosync_totemsrp: Maybe completed.
	corosync_totempg: Needs more work for fragmentation handling.
	  openais_cman: DONE.
	    clvmd: DONE.
	    rgmanager: Most of all but not completed.
	  openais_a: DONE.
	    openais_cpg: DONE.
	      groupd: DONE.
	      fenced: DONE.
	      dlm_controld: Needs much more work.
	      gfs_controld: Nothing done yet.
	    openais_evt: Needs much more work.
	    openais_clm: Needs much more work.
	    openais_ckpt: Nothing done yet.
	  flowcontrol: DONE.
	  sync: DONE.
	  sync2: DONE.


Background
----------

Dissectors for the base protocols are already submmited as a patch to
wireshark project[1]. However, it has not been included to the official
source tree.

So that shooting the trouble about RHCS and understanding the
protocols NOW, I provide the dissectors as a dynamic loadadble plugin.
I assumed you are using Fedora-14. 

A dissector for protocol used between ccsd is not built because
the dissector uses tcp_dissect_pdus function.  It is declared in
wireshark/epan/dissectors/packet-tcp.h, however is is not included
in wireshark-devel package[2]. 

Building & Installing
----------------------

   $ bash autogen.sh
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make rpm
   $ sudo rpm -Uvh build/RPM/*/wireshark-plugin-rhcs*.rpm

When updating wireshark itself, don't forget to rebuild and install
wireshark-plugin-rhcs. The plugin is installed to the wireshark
version specific directory. In stead of installing the plugin
to the system directory, you can put it to ~/.wireshark/plugins.

Example captures
------------------
pcap/corosync-totemsrp--noencypted--2nodes.pcap
pcap/corosync-totemsrp--key:example.com--3nodes.pcap

corosync-totemsrp--noencypted--2nodes.pcap: The packets in this file are not
encrypted. So you can dissect the packets in this file with no special
operation. 

corosync-totemsrp--key:example.com--3nodes.pcap: The packets in this file are
encrypted. So a key is needed to decrypt them. Open the Preferences dialog and
choose COROSYNC/TOTEMNET in Protocols branch. You will see "Totemnet Layer of
Corosync Cluster Engine" dialog. Give a key, "example.com" to "Private Keys"
text field. Then push Apply or OK button.  See screenshots/corosync_totemnet__pref.png.

You can specify the private key with command line, too:

    wireshark  -o "corosync_totemnet.private_keys:${PRIVATE_KEY}"

If you don't specify key explicitly in cluster.conf, the name of cluster is used
as key.

You can specify multiple keys with command line:

    wireshark  -o "corosync_totemnet.private_keys:${PRIVATE_KEY0};${PRIVATE_KEY1}"

Semicolon is the separator here.
